Title: About

I'm Kevin Galens, a Software Engineer interested in Genomics, Data Science and large distributed systems. I've worked in the fields of Bioinformatics, Genomics and Engineering in different capacities for the past 14 years. In my free time, I torture myself by being terrible at golf, playing volleyball, or travelling, when we're not being ravaged by a global pandemic. I also used to dabble with photography. You can view some of my work by visiting my Flickr or 500px links in the navigation.
